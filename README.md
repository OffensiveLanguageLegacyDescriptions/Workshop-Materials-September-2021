# Workshop-Materials-September-2021
These are the materials distributed at a workshop held in September 2021 on Offensive Language in Legacy Descriptions. the pack contains materials, including process documents and an offensive term list that will aid in adopting computational processes that identify offensive language in legacy descriptions. 
There is a content warning for the materials in this pack, namely the offensive language dictionary - this contains lots of potentially upsetting terms. It is not necessary to browse this file for to conduct your checks. 
AntConc will also need to be used for this task, or similar corpus analysis software.
If you have any questions, problems or issues then do please either post them in the Github repository or email to TestBedLeeds@gmail.com - since the TestBed project has ended this account is only monitored intermittently in our spare time so the reply may not be especially speedy, but we will get back to you eventually.
